      "full_script": "[ANCHOR_A] Good evening, I'm Patricia Holt. Here's what we're following this hour. The Senate Appropriations Committee remains deadlocked over the one-point-two trillion dollar infrastructure package, with rural broadband funding emerging as the key sticking point. Republican members are demanding stricter oversight provisions before moving forward.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] Thanks Patricia. Federal mediators have walked away from negotiations at Dunmore Port as the workers' strike enters its fourth week. The National Labor Relations Board says talks have completely stalled over pension benefits, leaving the critical shipping hub paralyzed.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Marcus, the Environmental Protection Agency is escalating on two fronts tonight. The agency has launched a criminal investigation into Gulfmark Petrochemical after whistleblower documents allegedly revealed the company concealed toxic emissions data for eight years.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And Patricia, the EPA has also announced federal oversight of Toledo's entire municipal water system. This comes as the agency escalates its investigation into the city's ongoing water contamination crisis, with a regional administrator now taking direct control of operations.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] We'll continue following these developing stories. I'm Patricia Holt, with Marcus Webb. Thanks for watching This News Now.",
