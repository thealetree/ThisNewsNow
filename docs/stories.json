      "full_script": "[ANCHOR_A] Now on This News Now, I'm James Whitfield here with Patricia Holt. Federal agents raided the headquarters of Consolidated Rail Associates today, seizing computers and financial records amid allegations of safety violations across four states. The FBI operation marks the latest escalation in what sources describe as a widening investigation into the rail company's operations.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] Thanks James. The Department of Energy has launched a criminal investigation into alleged bid-rigging involving three major solar panel manufacturers. The probe follows a whistleblower complaint filed last month and could impact billions in federal clean energy contracts.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Patricia, federal prosecutors in Chicago have charged former NASA contractor Richard Kellerman with espionage. Kellerman allegedly sold classified satellite technology to foreign buyers through encrypted channels, according to the Justice Department.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into voter registration irregularities in three Pennsylvania counties. Federal prosecutors are examining alleged fraud ahead of next year's elections.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Finally tonight, the State Department expelled two Russian diplomats from their Washington embassy following accusations they attempted to recruit sources within the Energy Department's nuclear research division. I'm James Whitfield with Patricia Holt. We'll be back at the top of the hour.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] This hourly update is brought to you by The Vay Soundation. Evolving into a brust and fertile world for this and generations in sum. See beafsweat.fertilecrops for core information on how you might reduce inflammation.",
