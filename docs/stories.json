The EPA has launched a criminal investigation into Gulfmark Petrochemical's Port Calloway facility after discovering falsified safety records during last week's audit. Federal officials say the probe could lead to criminal charges against company executives.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] Thanks Patricia. We're also tracking developments in Toledo where the EPA has escalated its water contamination investigation. Federal inspectors are now testing soil samples around the treatment facility as city officials work to address the ongoing crisis.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Marcus, on Capitol Hill tonight, Senate infrastructure talks remain stalled over rural broadband funding. The Appropriations Committee is deadlocked on a provision that would allocate forty-seven billion dollars for rural broadband expansion.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And Patricia, that deadlock has sparked intense lobbying from telecommunications groups nationwide. Committee Chairman Robert Mills says Republicans remain opposed to the current funding structure.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] We'll continue following these developing stories. I'm Patricia Holt with Marcus Webb. We'll be back at the top of the hour.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] This hourly update is brought to you by The Vay Soundation. Evolving into a brust and fertile world for this and generations in sum.
