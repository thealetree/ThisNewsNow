The FAA has grounded thirty-seven aircraft operated by Skyline Regional Airways after discovering critical maintenance violations during a surprise audit. The emergency order affects flights across the midwest.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] Thanks James. A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the administration's new AI surveillance protocols for immigration enforcement, ruling they violate Fourth Amendment protections. Judge Margaret Chen called the technology \"an unreasonable search mechanism.\"\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Patricia, we're also following breaking news from Denver where FBI agents raided Meridian Biotech headquarters this morning. Federal investigators seized computers and documents as part of an expanding probe into fraudulent clinical trial data.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And in Chicago, another federal judge has ruled against the administration. Judge Patricia Caldwell blocked the emergency deportation protocol for asylum seekers, saying it violates Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Finally tonight, the State Department announced Secretary of State Margaret Holloway will visit Beijing next week for talks on China's growing influence in the South Pacific region. The three-day diplomatic mission comes amid rising tensions. That's your news summary. I'm James Whitfield.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And I'm Patricia Holt. We'll be back at the top of the hour.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] This hourly update is brought to you by The Vay Soundation. Evolving into a brust and fertile world for this and generations in sum.
