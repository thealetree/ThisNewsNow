A federal judge in Phoenix has blocked the administration's cross-border deportation policy, ruling it violates due process rights. The injunction halts immediate enforcement across Arizona's southern border.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] Thanks Patricia. Another federal judge in San Antonio has similarly ruled against the administration's border detention policy for asylum seekers. Judge Rebecca Martinez ordered an immediate review of all cases from the past six months, citing due process violations.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] Meanwhile, federal prosecutors in Denver have charged former Consolidated Rail Associates CEO Michael Brennan with embezzling forty-three million dollars in pension funds. The Justice Department alleges the fraud occurred over several years.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And Patricia, we're also following a third federal court ruling tonight on asylum policy. A judge has blocked the administration's expedited processing procedures, ordering a comprehensive review of recent cases.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] That's our update for this hour. I'm Patricia Holt with James Whitfield. This News Now continues after this break.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] This hourly update is brought to you by The Vay Soundation.
