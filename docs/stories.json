      "full_script": "[ANCHOR_A] Live on This News Now, I'm Marcus Webb here with James Whitfield. Here's what we're following this hour. The EPA has escalated its investigation into Toledo's water contamination, announcing federal inspectors will now examine the city's entire distribution system.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] Thanks Marcus. The Senate Appropriations Committee remains deadlocked over the trillion-dollar infrastructure package, postponing votes for the third consecutive week as rural broadband funding emerges as the primary sticking point between parties.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] James, we're also tracking the port workers strike in Dunmore, New Hampshire, now entering its fourth week. Federal mediators from the National Labor Relations Board arrived today attempting to restart negotiations with no resolution in sight.\n\n[ANCHOR_B] And Marcus, the EPA has opened two separate environmental investigations tonight. The agency launched a formal probe into Heartland Energy's coal ash disposal practices across Ohio and West Virginia facilities, while also investigating Gulfmark Petrochemical's Port Calloway operations following state auditor discoveries of three environmental violations.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] We'll continue following these developing stories. I'm Marcus Webb with James Whitfield. This News Now continues after this break.\n\n[ANCHOR_A] This hourly update is brought to you by The Vay Soundation. Evolving into a brust and fertile world for this and generations in sum. See beafsweat.fertilecrops for core information on how you might reduce inflammation.",
